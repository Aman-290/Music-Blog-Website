        <div class="aboutinst">If you are interested in learning a new instrument, playing the acoustic guitar is a
            great choice. With some basic knowledge of the mechanics of the guitar, you can be playing your favorite
            songs in no time. Guitars are versatile instruments, and though they are difficult to master, anyone can
            start playing a few songs with only a few hours of practice.

                there are still other things to take into consideration. Look for the best size and price for your
                lifestyle. Avoid buying budget acoustic guitars, as they are typically made poorly and are very
                difficult to
                play. Typically, look for guitars that cost, at least, $300. These are better quality and have a better

                <li id="LI_4">
                    Find a guitar with low action. The action is the distance from the strings to the neck of the
                    guitar. A high action means you have to press down harder on the strings which can be painful and
                    difficult for beginners. Finding a guitar with low action will make it easier and more comfortable
                    to play.
                </li>
                <li id="LI_5">
                    Always buy wooden acoustic guitars. Although you can sometimes find acoustic guitars that are made
                    of composite material, their sound isn’t as good as classic wood acoustics.
                </li>
                <li id="LI_6">
                    Avoid a ¾ size guitar, even if you or your hands seem very small. The sound this size of guitar
                    creates is not as good as a full size, and with practice, even a very small person or child can play
                    a full-sized guitar.
                </li>
                <li id="LI_7">
                    If you are left-handed, be sure to purchase a special left-handed guitar. Otherwise, the strings
                    will all be in reverse order for you.

                <li id="LI_8">
                    Don’t be afraid to use an old or used guitar instead of buying new. As long as the guitar is in good
                    condition and makes a good sound, there is no problem playing a used instrument. Many people think
                    they sound better, even.

            <p><b id="B_2">2Learn the anatomy of your guitar.</b> Before you start playing, it is important that you
                understand all
                the basic parts of a guitar. While the "body," the big rounded base of the guitar, is obvious, knowing
                the other parts makes playing much easier.</p>
            <ul id="UL_3">
                <li id="LI_4">
                    The neck of the guitar is the long narrow part of the guitar where you can find the strings. It is
                    on the bottom, with the fingerboard (or sometimes called the fretboard) on top. The flat place you
                    hold the strings to is the fingerboard.
                </li>
                <li id="LI_5">
                    The headstock is the wooden piece at the end of the neck where the tuners are located. This is where
                    the strings end.s.
                </li>
                <li id="LI_6">
                    The fret wires are thin metal strips that go across the fingerboard. A fret is a space between two
                    fret wires. The first fret is the one closest to the headstock, and they count up as you move
                    towards the body of the guitar.
                </li>
                <li id="LI_7">
                    If you are left-handed, be sure to purchase a special left-handed guitar. Otherwise, the strings
                    will all be in reverse order for you.
                </li>
                <li id="LI_8">
                    The bridge is the small metal or plastic bit on the body of the guitar that the strings are attached
                    to. Right next to the soundhole. This is where you begin if you need to put new strings on your
                    guitar.

                    Find a guitar with low action. The action is the distance from the strings to the neck of the
                    guitar. A high action means you have to press down harder on the strings which can be painful and
                    difficult for beginners. Finding a guitar with low action will make it easier and more comfortable
                    to play.

                    Always buy wooden acoustic guitars. Although you can sometimes find acoustic guitars that are made
                    of composite material, their sound isn’t as good as classic wood acoustics.

                    Avoid a ¾ size guitar, even if you or your hands seem very small. The sound this size of guitar
                    creates is not as good as a full size, and with practice, even a very small person or child can play
                    a full-sized guitar.

                    If you are left-handed, be sure to purchase a special left-handed guitar. Otherwise, the strings
                    will all be in reverse order for you.

                    Don’t be afraid to use an old or used guitar instead of buying new. As long as the guitar is in good
                    condition and makes a good sound, there is no problem playing a used instrument. Many people think
                    they sound better, even.
