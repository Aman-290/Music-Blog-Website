        <div class="aboutinst">Mastering the ukulele takes even talented musicians many years of study, but you can learn
            the basics of playing this instrument in a relatively short period of time. Once you have these under your
            belt, you'll have to practice for these habits and techniques for them to become second nature. With a
            little time and effort, before you know it, you'll be playing with proper posture, hand position, and you'll
            be reading music, too.

                are called according to the name of each key's associated note. Notes range from A to G ascendingly, so
                letters increase moving to the right on the ukulele (as in A → B → C) and decease moving to the left
                (as in C → B → A).</p>
            <ul id="UL_3">
                <li id="LI_4">
                    Once you reach the end or beginning of the note sequence, it repeats. So when moving to the right up
                    the ukulele, G → A → B, whereas moving to the left yields A → G → F.
                    The 36 black keys on the ukulele represent a half-step difference in tone between.

                    The 36 black keys on the ukulele represent a half-step difference in tone between white key notes.
                    A sharp (♯) is a half-step up, and a flat (♭) a half-step down. Therefore, the black key notes have
                    two different possible names. For example, the black note between F and G could either be called
                    both F♯ or G♭.
                </li>
                <li id="LI_6">
                    Easily locate the C note on your ukulele by finding the white key immediately to the left of a
                    group of 2 black keys. The C key closest to the middle of your ukulele should be middle C, which is
                    a central note for most beginner level songs.
                </li>
                <li id="LI_7">
                    If you are left-handed, be sure to purchase a special left-handed ukulele. Otherwise, the strings
                    will all be in reverse order for you.

                    Don’t be afraid to use an old or used ukulele instead of buying new. As long as the ukulele is in good
                    condition and makes a good sound, there is no problem playing a used instrument. Many people think
                    they sound better, even.

                understand all
                the basic parts of a ukulele. While the "body," the big rounded base of the ukulele, is obvious, knowing
                the other parts makes playing much easier.</p>

                <li id="LI_4">
                    The neck of the ukulele is the long narrow part of the ukulele where you can find the strings. It is
                    on the bottom, with the fingerboard (or sometimes called the fretboard) on top. The flat place you
                    hold the strings to is the fingerboard.
                </li>
                <li id="LI_5">
                    The headstock is the wooden piece at the end of the neck where the tuners are located. This is where
                    the strings end.s.
                </li>
                <li id="LI_6">
                    The fret wires are thin metal strips that go across the fingerboard. A fret is a space between two
                    fret wires. The first fret is the one closest to the headstock, and they count up as you move
                    towards the body of the ukulele.

                    The bridge is the small metal or plastic bit on the body of the ukulele that the strings are attached
                    to. Right next to the soundhole. This is where you begin if you need to put new strings on your
                    ukulele.

                    Find a ukulele with low action. The action is the distance from the strings to the neck of the
                    ukulele. A high action means you have to press down harder on the strings which can be painful and
                    difficult for beginners. Finding a ukulele with low action will make it easier and more comfortable
                    to play.

                    Always buy wooden acoustic ukuleles. Although you can sometimes find acoustic ukuleles that are made
                    of composite material, their sound isn’t as good as classic wood acoustics.

                    Avoid a ¾ size ukulele, even if you or your hands seem very small. The sound this size of ukulele
                    creates is not as good as a full size, and with practice, even a very small person or child can play
                    a full-sized ukulele.

                <li id="LI_7">
                    If you are left-handed, be sure to purchase a special left-handed ukulele. Otherwise, the strings
                    will all be in reverse order for you.

                <li id="LI_8">
                    Don’t be afraid to use an old or used ukulele instead of buying new. As long as the ukulele is in good
                    condition and makes a good sound, there is no problem playing a used instrument. Many people think
                    they sound better, even.
